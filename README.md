# EmotionRecognitionOnHologram

A project in Hack the North 2016--Canada's biggest hackathon

A system that can recognize human facial expression and analyze emotions (i.e: happy, sad, angry...) using CV and Machine Learning. After that, the human emotion data is streamed to a Unity character which is projected on a DIY pyramid hologram.
